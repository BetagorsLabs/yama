## Demo Video Script (90 seconds)

**0-15s**: Problem
"Building a production backend today means writing thousands of lines of boilerplate..."
[Screen: messy Express/NestJS codebase]

**15-30s**: Solution
"What if you could describe your entire API in 80 lines?"
[Screen: Clean yama.yaml file]

**30-45s**: Demo
"Watch this: YAML config + TypeScript handler = Full CRUD API"
[Screen: Split view - YAML left, generated API right]

**45-60s**: Features
"Auto-generated OpenAPI, type-safe SDK, JWT auth, all included"
[Screen: Swagger UI + SDK usage]

**60-75s**: Deploy
"Deploy anywhere. Fly, Railway, Docker, VPS..."
[Screen: fly deploy command]

**75-90s**: CTA
"Start building in under 15 seconds. npm create yama@latest"
[Screen: GitHub stars + yamajs.com]

## Twitter/X Thread Template

🧵 Thread for launch:

1/ 🚀 Just launched Yama JS - the backend framework that removes 90% of the code

Full CRUD API with auth, docs, and type-safe SDKs in ~80 lines

No more boilerplate. No more config hell. Just ship. 🔥

[Link + screenshot]

2/ Here's what you get out of the box:
✅ Auto-generated OpenAPI spec
✅ Type-safe client SDK
✅ JWT authentication
✅ PostgreSQL support
✅ Database migrations
✅ Docker setup
✅ CI/CD config

All from a single YAML file + handlers

3/ Compare this to Express/NestJS:

Yama: 80 lines
Express: 400+ lines
NestJS: 500+ lines

Same functionality. 80% less code. 🤯

[Comparison table image]

4/ The secret? Configuration-first architecture

Define structure in YAML → Write logic in TypeScript → Deploy anywhere

The framework handles routing, validation, docs, and SDK generation

5/ Example: Building a Todo API

[Code screenshot: yama.yaml + handler]

That's it. You now have:
- Full CRUD
- OpenAPI docs
- Type-safe client
- JWT auth

Ready to deploy.

6/ It runs everywhere:
🐳 Docker
✈️ Fly.io
🚂 Railway
🖥️ Any VPS
☁️ AWS/GCP/Azure

Zero lock-in. 100% open source. MPL-2.0 licensed.

7/ Try it now:

```bash
npm create yama@latest
```

## Press Kit

**One-liner**: The backend framework that removes 90% of the code while keeping 100% of the power.

**Elevator pitch**: Yama is a configuration-first backend platform that turns YAML configs into production-ready APIs with auto-generated OpenAPI specs, type-safe SDKs, and built-in auth. Write 80 lines instead of 800.

**Key stats**:
- ~80 lines for full CRUD + auth (vs 400-500 in traditional frameworks)
- Auto-generated OpenAPI + Swagger UI
- Type-safe client SDK out of the box
- Runs anywhere (Docker, Fly, Railway, VPS)
- 100% open source (MPL-2.0)
- Zero vendor lock-in

**Target audience**: 
- Indie hackers building SaaS products
- Startup teams shipping MVPs fast
- Developers tired of boilerplate
- API-first companies

**What makes it different**:
1. Configuration-first (structure in YAML, logic in TS)
2. Auto-generates everything (OpenAPI, SDK, types)
3. Batteries included (auth, migrations, Docker)
4. Zero lock-in (it's just Node.js + PostgreSQL)

**Founder story**: Built by an indie developer frustrated with writing the same boilerplate for every new project. After the 50th time setting up Express + TypeORM + Swagger, decided there had to be a better way.
